## Getting PaintFx - Releases
Application builds can be found under [releases](https://github.com/georgioyammine/PaintFX/releases) for both Windows and Mac devices.

You can run the release by opening  bin/PaintFX[.bat]

### Source code
We have two important branches:

* **main** -> Java 11 and javaFx 11 and above (actively developed branch)
* **jdk-8** -> Java 8 (no longer in development)

## Getting Started
- ### Required Software dependencies
  1. JDK 11+: OpenJDK 11 (LTS) - JVM: Hotspot, AdoptOpenJDK 11, available at https://adoptopenjdk.net/.

- ### Dependencies automatically installed by Maven
  * org.openjfx JavaFX 16
  * org.jfxtras jmetro 11.6.15
  * org.openjfx javafx-swing 15.0.1

- ### Running Process
  1. Run via IDE launcher.Main
  2. Run via Maven: `mvn javafx:run`

- ### Building Process
  `mvn clean javafx:jlink`

  - #### cross building
    To create a cross platform build (for a different OS):
    First, you will need the JDKs for those other platforms. Download them as archives (zip or tar.gz), not installers from https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html, and unpack them to directories of your choice.
    Then pass this to the jmodsPath tag in the pom.xml file as follows:
    ``` 
    <plugin>
            <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
            <artifactId>javafx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.6</version>
            <configuration>
                <launcher>Information Theory Calculator</launcher>
                <mainClass>launcher.Main</mainClass>
                <!--for building for cross platform include the platform jdk below (/Contents/Home/jmods)-->
                <jmodsPath>
                        <!--mac-->
                    C:/Program Files/AdoptOpenJDK/mac/OpenJDK11U-jdk_x64_mac_hotspot_11.0.11_9/jdk-11.0.11+9/Contents/Home/jmods
                </jmodsPath>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    ```

    After passing the target JDK, running `mvn clean javafx:jlink` will generate the image for the target OS. 
    
    Generated Image can be found under target/image.
